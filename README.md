# EvolutionaryAlgorithms
A JAVA package for implementing evolutionary algorithms, including genetic programming.

This package defines the basic functions required by any Evolutionary Algorithm. The package is Object Oriented based, with key classes for implementing:

The behaviour of the metapopulation
The behaviour of the population
The behaviour of the mating strategy
The behaviour of selecting mates.
The behaviour for recombining and mutating a given solution.
How data is encoded.
How data is decoded.

In addition, an extension of this package for dealing with Genetic Programming issues has been implemented.
